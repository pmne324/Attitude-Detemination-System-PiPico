# Attitude Determintaion System for Raspberry PiPico (Micropython)</br>
This repository present an attitude determination system (ADS) software for raspberry PiPico that can be used for UAV, CanSAT, QubeSAT and all device with orientation and position sensors</br>
</br>
</br>
## Require hardwares:
> Raspberry PiPico </br>
> GY87 Module (for imu and magnetometer) </br>
> GPS NEO6 (or later version)</br>
> USB to TTl (or any other way to transfer data through UART)</br>
</br>

### I'm trying to improve it for near future and you can help me in it.</br>
